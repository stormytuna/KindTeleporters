# Kind Teleporters

Makes teleporters a little nicer. When teleporting, you will not drop your held item! Only the rest of your inventory :)

Changelog

- v1.0.0
  - Released
- v1.0.1
  - Fixed an issue where you could only teleport while holding an object
- v1.0.2
  - Possibly fixed an issue where teleporting while holding an item would get you stuck
